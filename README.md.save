Fine-grained control â€“ AWS Global Accelerator lets you set a traffic dial for your regional endpoint groups, to dial 
traffic up or down for a specific AWS Region when you conduct performance testing or application updates. In addition, 
if you have stateful applications, you can choose to direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, regardless 
of the source port and protocol, to maintain client affinity. These features give you fine-grained control. By 
default, the traffic dial is set to 100% for all regional endpoint groups.
Also supports bring your own IP (BYOIP) so you can use your own IPs on the AWS edge network.
